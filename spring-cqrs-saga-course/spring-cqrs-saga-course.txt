Event driven microservices
a. generally microservices commuicate using http request/response model
 however in case one microservice need to all n microservices and in future more service may come
	we need to do something to reduce this on to many relation ship and n netwrok calls from cleint using req/res model whihc is blocking and slow
b. we can decouple this communication using event driven architechture using kafka/rabbit mq like event broker	

saga
a . choreography based : uses mesasge broker and all microservie communicate via events -> event driven microservices
	in this individual service have code for publishing succes event as well as rollback event consumption code
b. orchestration based : also uses message broker
  however in this a seperate microservice exist whihc have undoing code for each fo the failure events
	in orchestration do ,redo and undo code is present in individual microservice but here the undo code and redo code is present on seperate microservice
	in short the orchestration service have steps of do/redo/undo at one place and can be helpful for new dev to understand the actual flow
	
	event sourcing: instead of stroing only latest state we keep track of all the state modification event is some D.B like h2 or mysql or mongo
	at any point of failure we can run through these event store to find the latest state
	it also helps in debugging as we can replay the history of events upto specfic time and see within whihc range of events defect arised
		and hence we can debug only those specific event/events and business code


so using kafka with code logic for workflow in individual service is example of choreography
but axon helps in orchestration as logic/workflow of do redo movement is present in one of the micro service/seprate service
	it can be kept in the microservice itself whihc starts the flow

overall flow in command apis:

message interceptor aka command interceptor is good place for command validation as it saves wrong command to be pusehd to command bus
http request -> hibernate validation -> command controller -> commandgateway dispatch -> message interceptor(another place for validation of command) command bus -> 
			-> command handler (validation of command and creation of events) -> event bus (push to event source(d.b like h2/mongo) and then to kafka for query api)
			-> event sourcing handler (update the aggregate state) -> event handler from query api picks event from event bus and update D.B
			

overall flow in query apis:
http request -> query contrller -> querygateway dispatch -> query bus(internal) -> queryhandler calls db and create object
    -> copletablefuture object is taken from query bus result
	
we can see at each level even within command and query api it is decoupled and even internal calls are async using internal bus
